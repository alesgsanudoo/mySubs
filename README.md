# MySubs
## Introduction
MySubs Tracker, a webpage I created to keep track of all my subscriptions since I often forgot the billing dates. This helps me manage my finances more effectively. While I could have used Excel, I decided to turn it into a project for one of my CS classes, and it turned out great. I aimed to make it as secure as possible, and it’s built using Next.js and MongoDB.
